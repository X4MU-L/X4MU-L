### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!!
### A little Intro About me:

_I'm a detail-oriented problem solver with a passion for web development. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML, I create seamless and visually stunning front-end experiences. I also bring my expertise in Material UI and Tailwind CSS to the table, ensuring user-friendly designs._

_But I'm not just limited to the front-end. I also have a solid grasp of backend development, particularly with Flask, Python, and Node. My versatility allows me to bridge the gap between frontend and backend seamlessly, delivering end-to-end solutions._

_I'm driven by a desire to create elegant and efficient web applications that solve real-world problems. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your next project._
